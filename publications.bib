abstract = { We report the first detection of the X-ray polarization of the bright transient Swift J1727.8−1613 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The observation was performed at the beginning of the 2023 discovery outburst, when the source resided in the bright hard state. We find a time- and energy-averaged polarization degree of 4.1% ± 0.2% and a polarization angle of 2.°2 ± 1.°3 (errors at 68% confidence level; this translates to ∼20 $\sigma$ significance of the polarization detection). This finding suggests that the hot corona emitting the bulk of the detected X-rays is elongated, rather than spherical. The X-ray polarization angle is consistent with that found in submillimeter wavelengths. Since the submillimeter polarization was found to be aligned with the jet direction in other X-ray binaries, this indicates that the corona is elongated orthogonal to the jet. },

abstract = {We present the results of the first X-ray polarimetric observation of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1957+115, performed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer in May 2023. The binary system has been in a high-soft spectral state since its discovery and is thought to host a black hole. The $\sim$571 ks observation reveals a linear polarisation degree of $1.9\% \pm 0.6\%$ and a polarisation angle of $-41^\circ.8 \pm 7^\circ.9$ in the 2-8 keV energy range. Spectral modelling is consistent with the dominant contribution coming from the standard accretion disc, while polarimetric data suggest a significant role of returning radiation: photons that are bent by strong gravity effects and forced to return to the disc surface, where they can be reflected before eventually reaching the observer. In this setting, we find that models with a black hole spin lower than 0.96 and an inclination lower than $50^\circ$ are disfavoured.},

@article{Gurpide2022,
abstract = {Context. The presence of large ionised gaseous nebulae found around some ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) provides the means to assess the mechanical and radiative feedback of the central source, and hence constrain the efficiency and impact on the surroundings of the super-Eddington regime powering most of these sources. NGC 1313 X-1 is an archetypal ULX, reported to be surrounded by abnormally high [O I]$\lambda$6300/H$\alpha$ > 0.1 ratios, and for which high-resolution spectroscopy in X-rays has hinted at the presence of powerful outflows. Aims. We report observations taken with the integral field unit Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) mounted at the Very Large Telescope of NGC 1313 X-1 in order to confirm the presence of a nebula inflated by the winds, investigate its main sources of ionisation and estimate the mechanical output of the source. Methods. We investigated the morphology, kinematics, and sources of ionisation of the bubble through the study of the main nebular lines. We compared the main line ratios with spatially resolved Baldwin'Phillips'Terlevich diagrams and with the prediction from radiative shock libraries, which allows us to differentiate regions excited by shocks from those excited by extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Results. We detect a bubble of 452 × 266 pc in size, roughly centred around the ULX, which shows clear evidence of shock ionisation in the outer edges. We estimate shock velocities to be in the-160-180 km s-1 range based on the line ratios. This suggests that an average and continuous outflow power of ∼(2-4.5)×-1040 erg s-1 over a timescale of (4.5-7.8)×-105 yr is required to inflate the bubble. In the interior of the bubble and closer to the ULX we detect an extended (∼140 pc) X-ray ionised region. Additionally, we detect two supernova remnants coincidentally close to the ULX bubble of which we also report age and explosion energy estimates. Conclusions. The elongated morphology and the kinematics of the bubble strongly suggest that the bubble is being inflated by winds and/or jets emanating from the central source, supporting the presence of winds found through X-ray spectroscopy. The estimated mechanical power is comparable to or higher than the X-ray luminosity of the source, which provides additional evidence in support of NGC 1313 X-1 harbouring a super-Eddington accretor.},

abstract = {In our self-similar, analytical, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion-ejection solution, the density at the base of the outflow is explicitly dependent on the disc accretion rate - a unique property of this class of solutions. We had earlier found that the ejection index $p > ∼ 0.1 (Macc \alpharp)$ is a key MHD parameter that decides if the flow can cause absorption lines in the high resolution X-ray spectra of black hole binaries. Here, we choose three dense warm solutions with p = 0.1, 0.3, 0.45 and carefully develop a methodology to generate spectra which are convolved with the Athena and XRISM response functions to predict what they will observe seeing through such MHD outflows. In this paper two other external parameters were varied - extent of the disc, ro|max = 105,106, rG and the angle of the line of sight, i ∼10-25°. Resultant absorption lines (H and He-like Fe, Ca, Ar) change in strength and their profiles manifest varying degrees of asymmetry. We checked if (a) the lines and (ii) the line asymmetries are detected, in our suit of synthetic Athena and XRISM spectra. Our analysis shows that Athena should detect the lines and their asymmetries for a standard 100 ks observation of a 100 mCrab source - lines with equivalent width as low as a few eV should be detected if the 6-8 keV counts are larger than 104-105 even for the least favourable simulated cases.},

abstract = {Large, energy-dependent X-ray polarisation is observed in 4U 1630-47, a black hole in an X-ray binary, in the high-soft emission state. In this state, X-ray emission is believed to be dominated by a thermal, geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disc. However, the observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) reveal an unexpectedly high polarisation degree, rising from 6% at 2 keV to 10% at 8 keV, which cannot be reconciled with standard models of thin accretion discs. We argue that an accretion disc with an only partially ionised atmosphere flowing away from the disc at mildly relativistic velocities can explain the observations.},

abstract = {The presence of blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries is the telltale of massive outflows called winds. These signatures are found almost exclusively in soft states of high-inclined systems, hinting at equatorial ejections originating from the accretion disk and deeply intertwined with the evolution of the outburst patterns displayed by these systems. In the wake of the launch of the new generation of X-ray spectrometers, studies of wind signatures remain mostly restricted to single sources and outbursts, with some of the recent detections departing from the commonly expected behaviors. We thus give an update to the current state of iron band absorption lines detections, through the analysis of all publicly available XMM-$Newton$-PN and $Chandra$-HETG exposures of known Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binary candidates. Our results agree with previous studies, with wind detections exclusively found in dipping, high-inclined sources, and almost exclusively in bright ($L_{X}>0.01L_{Edd}$) soft ($HR<0.8$) states, with blueshift values generally restricted to few 100 km s$^{-1}$. The line parameters indicate similar properties between objects and outbursts of single sources, and despite more than 20 years of data, very few sources have the HID sampling necessary to properly study the evolution of the wind during single outbursts. We provide an online tool with details of the wind signatures and outburst evolution data for all sources in the sample.},

abstract = {We report on a campaign on the bright black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 centered around five observations by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). This is the first time it has been possible to trace the evolution of the X-ray polarization of a black hole X-ray binary across a hard to soft state transition. The 2--8 keV polarization degree slowly decreased from $\sim$4\% to $\sim$3\% across the five observations, but remained in the North-South direction throughout. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we measure the intrinsic 7.25 GHz radio polarization to align in the same direction. Assuming the radio polarization aligns with the jet direction (which can be tested in the future with resolved jet images), this implies that the X-ray corona is extended in the disk plane, rather than along the jet axis, for the entire hard intermediate state. This in turn implies that the long ($\gtrsim$10 ms) soft lags that we measure with the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) are dominated by processes other than pure light-crossing delays. Moreover, we find that the evolution of the soft lag amplitude with spectral state differs from the common trend seen for other sources, implying that Swift J1727.8$-$1613 is a member of a hitherto under-sampled sub-population.},
