abstract: The presence of blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of Black
  Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries is the telltale of massive outflows called winds. These
  signatures are found almost exclusively in soft states of high-inclined systems,
  hinting at equatorial ejections originating from the accretion disk and deeply intertwined
  with the evolution of the outburst patterns displayed by these systems. In the wake
  of the launch of the new generation of X-ray spectrometers, studies of wind signatures
  remain mostly restricted to single sources and outbursts, with some of the recent
  detections departing from the commonly expected behaviors. We thus give an update
  to the current state of iron band absorption lines detections, through the analysis
  of all publicly available XMM-$Newton$-PN and $Chandra$-HETG exposures of known
  Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binary candidates. Our results agree with previous studies,
  with wind detections exclusively found in dipping, high-inclined sources, and almost
  exclusively in bright ($L_X>0.01L_Edd$) soft ($HR<0.8$) states, with blueshift values
  generally restricted to few 100 km s$^-1$. The line parameters indicate similar
  properties between objects and outbursts of single sources, and despite more than
  20 years of data, very few sources have the HID sampling necessary to properly study
  the evolution of the wind during single outbursts. We provide an online tool with
  details of the wind signatures and outburst evolution data for all sources in the
  sample.
